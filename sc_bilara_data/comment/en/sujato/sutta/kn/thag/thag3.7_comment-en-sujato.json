  "thag3.7:3.1": "I read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sikkhetha</i> as second person plural optative, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subhāsitassa</i> (etc.) as dative (of purpose), although we would expect the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āya</i> form in this sense. The commentary glosses with third singular and accusative (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>subhāsitaṁ sikkheyya</i>). However, this flattens this verse into the same third person voice as the previous two. Its distinctive diction, together with the fact that it exists as a separate verse at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.1/en/sujato#2.1'>SN 2.1:2.1</a> (where, further, it appears to be a quotation), suggest its separate origin and purpose.
