  "sn4.24:1.2": "According to the commentarial reckoning, this was in the fifth week after Awakening. ",
  "sn4.24:1.3": "This series of verses is a cleverly structured argument where Māra tries one method after another, always seeking to find something in the Buddha’s words or deeds that make him vulnerable. | Siddhattha had practiced for six years and had now only just realized Awakening, so either the number seven has been rounded up, or else Māra began his work before Siddhattha left home. ",
  "sn4.24:2.1": "Māra begins the contest of wits by insinuating that something must have gone wrong for the Buddha to end up where he is, trying to play on feelings of self-doubt. ",
  "sn4.24:3.1": "The Buddha rejoins with a series of bold and incontrovertible claims, shutting down the idea that he is self-loathing. ",
  "sn4.24:4.1": "Māra changes tack. Having failed to insinuate self-doubt, now he tries to use the Buddha’s very confidence against him. Surely he must be conceited to make such claims. ",
  "sn4.24:5.1": "The Buddha rejects the charge of conceit, as he has merely spoken of the truth, not of what he is attached to. ",
  "sn4.24:5.3": "The Buddha goes on the attack, asserting the limits of Māra’s knowledge. ",
  "sn4.24:6.1": "Māra accepts, for rhetorical purposes, the Buddha’s claim that he has found a path Māra cannot see. Better, he argues, for the Buddha to walk it alone and not teach anyone. ",
  "sn4.24:7.1": "The Buddha rejects this final parry, asserting that he will teach anyone who asks. ",
