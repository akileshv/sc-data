  "sn2.10:1.2": "Suriya, the sun, is one of the most prominent deities of the Vedas, appearing under many names and aspects as both celestial body and deity. ",
  "sn2.10:5.1": "The Buddha offers an extra verse to the Sun as compared to the Moon. ",
  "sn2.10:5.3": "The mention of “swallow” here confirms this detail of the mythology, which is also implied in the existence of a torture called “Rāhu’s mouth” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn13/en/sujato#14.3'>MN 13:14.3</a>). ",
  "sn2.10:5.4": "The Buddha is the “kinsman of the sun” as he is a scion of the royal Solar Lineage traced back to the sun himself. Both Sun and Moon attended  the Mahāsamayasutta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#14.3'>DN 20:14.3</a>) where, according to the commentary, they became stream-enterers and hence the Buddha’s spiritual “sons”. Symbolically the Buddha, by enabling the Sun’s “release” from the “confined space”, becomes the father of light and wisdom. "
