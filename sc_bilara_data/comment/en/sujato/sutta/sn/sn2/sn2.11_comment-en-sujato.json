  "sn2.11:1.2": "Candimasa is another form of the shining “moon”, echoing Vedic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>candramasa</i> (eg. Rig Veda 1.84.15, 10.64.3, Chāndogya Upaniṣad4.15.5, etc.). As often, there is no obvious link between the deity and the content of their verses. ",
  "sn2.11:3.4": "Rig Vedic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>raṇa</i> usually means “joy, delight” (eg. 8.96.16, 10.104.7) or occasionally “battle, strife, conflict” (see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn139/en/sujato'>MN 139</a>). The commentary explains it here as “vice, defilement”. But compare Rig Veda 10.112.10, where Indra the “bounteous” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>maghavan</i>) is urged to “battle” and bestow a share of winnings on devotees. Likewise at 10.113.4 Indra’s successful “battle” is a prelude to releasing the waters. Then there is the oft-quoted line <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhanañjayaṃ raṇe-raṇe</i> (“winner of the stakes in every battle”, 1.74.3, 6.16.15). These suggest emendation to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>raṇañjaya</i> (“victor in battle”), but this is not attested in Pali. On the other hand, the Chinese translation at SA 1303 seems to take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>raṇa</i> in the sense of “delight” (<span lang='lzh'>喜樂</span>). Also see the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uddāna</i> to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.50/en/sujato'>Thag 1.50</a>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vimalo ca raṇañjaho</i>, which supports the commentarial sense “free of defilement”. On the whole, since the sense “strife” is clearly attested, and the development of Vedic “joy” to commentarial “defilement” is not well-attested, I am inclined to accept the sense “strife” in all cases, while suspecting that the original of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>raṇañjaha</i> was <i lang='pi' translate='no'>raṇañjaya</i>.
