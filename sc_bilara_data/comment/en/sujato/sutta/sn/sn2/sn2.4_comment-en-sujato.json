  "sn2.4:1.2": "The name is variously spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>māgha</i> (like the previous Sutta) or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>māgadha</i>, suggesting he is the god “of Magadha”—but we meet no such deity elsewhere. I think it should be corrected to Maghada, “giver of bounty”, cf. Rig Vedic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>maghadeya</i> (7.67.9), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>indro maghāni dayate</i> (7.21.7). I adopt this spelling even though it is, so far as I know, unattested in manuscripts. See also note on next Sutta. ",
