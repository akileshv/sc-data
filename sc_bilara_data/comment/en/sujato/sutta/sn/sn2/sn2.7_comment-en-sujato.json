  "sn2.7:1.2": "This saying by Pañcālacaṇḍa is quoted by Udāyī and explained by Ānanda at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.42/en/sujato'>AN 9.42</a>. Pañcālacaṇḍa appears alongside Āḷavaka, the tutelary deity of Āḷavī, hinting that he may be the fierce (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>caṇḍa</i>) protector of the Pañcāla clan (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#10.16'>DN 32:10.16</a>). Several Pañcālacaṇḍas appear in the Jātakas: a licentious youth and a misogynistic chaplain (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja536/en/sujato'>Ja 536</a>), and a prince of Pañcāla (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja546/en/sujato'>Ja 546</a>). A Pañcālacaṇḍa appears as a Vedic teacher of the idea that speech is what unifies (Aitereya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6 = Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19, Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.27n). None of these, however, have any obvious relation to our text. ",
  "sn2.7:2.3": "The compound <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānamabujjhi</i> can be resolved as either <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānaṁ abujjhi</i> (“awakened to absorption”) or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānena abujjhi</i> (“awakened by means of absorption”). At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.42/en/sujato'>AN 9.42</a>, Ānanda explains that each stage of absorption is an “opening” relative to what came before, but still a “confinement”, and only Nibbāna is the opening without confinement. The thrust of the verse, therefore, is the Buddha’s insight into the nature of absorption, supporting the sense “awakened to absorption”. "
