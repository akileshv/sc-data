  "sn2.15:2.1": "This question is found in two variants: “how do you cross the flood” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kathaṁsu tarati oghaṁ</i>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.10/en/sujato#8.1'>Snp 1.10:8.1</a>) and “who here crosses the flood” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ko sūdha tarati oghaṁ</i>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.9/en/sujato#23.1'>Snp 1.9:23.1</a>). The pattern seems to be that the question matches others in the same verse, so here it is “who”. "
